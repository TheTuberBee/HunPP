C++ Hungarian defines for true Scythian chad programmers.

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository, navigate into it and create a `*.cpp` source file

1. Include the `#include "hpp.hpp"` preprocessor directive in your source code

1. Write some painfully unfunny code, then compile it with `gcc` or `clang` (NOTE: I haven't tested and won't test it with MSVC, because Microsoft is evil western spy stuff)

1. If it doesn't compile, check if you were faithful and polite enough in the source code. Try to use `ámen` often at the end of the lines and make sure you use `viszontlátásra` at the end of the file.

Check out `example.cpp` for further guideance (yes it is valid and it should compile).
